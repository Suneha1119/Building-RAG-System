Using LangChain framework, I built a  Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system that can utilize the power of LLM like Gemini 1.5 Pro to answer questions on the “Leave No Context Behind” paper published by Google. In this process, external data(i.e. the Leave No Context Behind Paper) is retrieved and then passed to the LLM during the generation step.
